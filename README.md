# Analysis-And-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
**Creating software to help computer science advisors access course information for students. **
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
**I approached the problem by first breaking it down into smaller tasks and identifying the necessary data structures to support the functionalities. Understanding data structures is crucial because they help organize and store data efficiently, which directly impacts the performance of the system.**
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
**When I hit any roadblocks, I tackled them by collaborating with peers and seeking feedback from instructors. This helped me gain new perspectives and find solutions to issues I faced during the project.**
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
**Working on this project has really expanded my approach to designing software. Iâ€™ve learned the importance of planning and structuring my code to make it more maintainable and adaptable. **
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**Now, I focus on writing programs that are not just functional but also easy to read and modify later on. This evolution in my coding style has made a big difference in how I develop programs moving forward!**
